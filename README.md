# Base-Conversion
This program gathers input from the console as a string, then determines the base of the input. It then converts binary/octal/decimal/hexadecimal values to binary bytes for storage. It can then convert to any of the other base types as required.

## What I Learned
* How to read a string and determine it's base
* How to use interfaces in Java
* What abstract classes are and how to use them
* How to store data as a common type that can be shared between classes (binary bytes)
* How to use a static `Factory` class to build various `<<interface>>` objects
* How to convert between bases one byte at a time
* Two's complement
* How to read and use UML diagrams
* Data structures and data management in Java
* StringBuilder class

## Tasks
- [ ] Finish the decimal base class implementation (last base class)
- [ ] Follow up on issue with returning unsigned binary bytes
- [ ] Investigate alternative common data storage options such as BigInteger
- [ ] Add support for hex strings with spaces between individual bytes (2 digits) as input
